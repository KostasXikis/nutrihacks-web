            <p>
              Finding a diet that helps control my IBD symptoms has been life changing. <br>
  
              After I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 12 years ago, I spent 7 years pretending my inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) didn’t exist and ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. 
              
              I was a college student, then a marathon runner, then a working young professional. I didn’t want anything in my life to make me different from my peers — especially my diet.
              
              As it happens, those were also the sickest, brain foggiest, and toughest years of my life. Coincidence? Hardly.
              
              It was only when I had become so exhausted and frustrated with my own illness that I had no other option but to start researching and experimenting with nutrition.
              
              After months of trial and error with food, I discovered the power that nutrition has to heal the body. I started feeling better, had more energy, and experienced far fewer hospitalizations.
              
              I also learned some valuable lessons along the way. <br>
              
              If your colon is already inflamed, certain vegetables can cause irritation during digestion.
              
              If you struggle with bloating, pain, or other symptoms, then I recommend removing high-fiber vegetables from your diet for a while or, if you don’t want to remove them entirely, roast them until they’re soft.
              
              While it may taste really good, too much sugar can wreak havoc on the body by promoting chronic inflammation and slowing down the healing process.<br>
              
              Food manufacturers also add sugar to many packaged and canned items, so it’s important to read labels before buying anything packaged.
              
              If you need a little bit of added sweetness, I recommend using a small amount of honey or maple syrup as a natural alternative.

              A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people who consumed more flavonoid-rich foods (around 7.5 cups of berries a month) were 80 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than those who ate no berries.<br> <br>

              This is likely because anti-inflammatory properties of flavonoids may preserve brain health.<br>
              
              Even adding small amounts of foods such as berries, apples, pears, and tea to your diet could boost your brain health.<br>
              
              You already know that adding a handful of blueberries to your postride oatmeal or slicing up an apple as an afternoon snack is good for your health. But it turns out, it’s also beneficial for your brain. Recent research has found that adding even small amounts of berries, apples, and pears, or having a cup of afternoon tea may help ward off Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
              
              The study, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, followed the flavonoid intake in 2,800 adults for 20 years to track how diet may be related to cognitive decline long-term. Researchers used dietary questionnaires filled out at medical exams about every four years. At the start of the study, all participants were free of Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and had an average age of 59.<br>

              My name is Jackie Sanchez (@itsjackie_), and I am 26 years old. I live in Ventura, California, and I am a health coach and personal trainer. I lost 30 pounds by going more plant-based, incorporating fasting into my diet, and channeling self-love.<br><br>

              I have struggled with my weight since the age of 12. I was the girl that was always on a diet but could never successfully lose weight. When I finally managed to lose some weight, it never lasted for the long term. I spent years losing and gaining the same 15 to 20 pounds over and over again.<br><br>
              
              At the end of 2015, I knew I was ready to move forward with my weight-loss journey. I wanted to feel comfortable in my skin. I joined a local gym that offered group fitness classes—and I was hooked! I loved the environment, the trainers, the classes, and the workouts. I was also introduced to counting macros and successfully lost 30 pounds in the course of that year. But I ended up regaining the weight.<br><br>

              I was devastated, but a deeper part of me knew that I wasn’t learning the real lesson: self-love had to come first.<br>
              I finally understood that this journey couldn't solely be about the weight loss—it had to be about self-love. So in 2017 I moved to Playa del Carmen, Mexico, in an effort to change up my life and heal mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.<br><br>

              With the warmer weather comes a plethora of shop-made and ready-to-go picnic staples from your favourite supermarkets (Marks and Spencer, we're looking at you), prepared for you to enjoy in the park, on the beach or from your living room sofa—whatever you'd prefer. <br><br>

              Before you dive in and spend your hard earned cash on not so nutrient dense foods, picnics don't have to totally derail your nutrition. Far from it, as registered nutritionist and food expert Jenna Hope (@jennahopenutrition) is here to prove.<br><br>
              
              Women's Health sent Hope into her local M&S to share what she'd buy for a picnic with friends.<br><br>
